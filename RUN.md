## Deployment Steps

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

Navigate to the repository folder and install required packages:

```powershell
cd <path-to-repository>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Required packages:**
- `azure-identity` - Authentication library
- `msgraph-sdk` - Microsoft Graph API client
- `requests` - HTTP library for REST APIs
- `pandas`, `openpyxl` - Report generation (optional)

### 2. Create Service Principal

Run the service principal setup script to create Azure AD app registration with required permissions:

```powershell
.\setup-service-principal.ps1
```

**What the script does:**
1. Opens browser for admin authentication (Global Administrator or Application Administrator required)
2. Creates Azure AD app registration: "M365 Copilot Readiness Assessment Tool" with **read-only permissions**
3. Grants API permissions (Application permissions - all read-only):
   
   **Microsoft Graph API:**
   - User.Read.All - Read user profiles
   - Directory.Read.All - Read directory data
   - Organization.Read.All - Read organization info
   - SecurityEvents.Read.All - Read security events
   - SecurityIncident.Read.All - Read security incidents
   - ThreatIndicators.Read.All - Read threat indicators
   - ThreatHunting.Read.All - Read threat hunting data
   - ThreatAssessment.Read.All - Read threat assessments
   - IdentityRiskyUser.Read.All - Read risky users
   - IdentityRiskEvent.Read.All - Read risk events
   - Policy.Read.All - Read policies
   - RoleManagement.Read.Directory - Read directory roles
   - UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All - Read authentication methods
   - AccessReview.Read.All - Read access reviews
   - DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All - Read managed devices
   - DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All - Read device configurations
   - NetworkAccessPolicy.Read.All - Read network access policies
   - Application.Read.All - Read applications
   - AuditLog.Read.All - Read audit logs
   - Reports.Read.All - Read usage reports
   - Sites.Read.All - Read SharePoint sites
   - Files.Read.All - Read files
   - ExternalConnection.Read.All - Read Graph connectors
   - Channel.ReadBasic.All - Read Teams channels
   - OnlineMeetings.Read.All - Read online meetings
   - Bookings.Read.All - Read bookings
   - People.Read.All - Read people data
   - Printer.Read.All - Read printers
   - WorkplaceAnalytics-Reports.Read.All - Read workplace analytics
   - InformationProtectionPolicy.Read - Read information protection policies
   
   **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint API:**
   - Machine.Read.All - Read machine data
   
   **Office 365 Management API:**
   - ActivityFeed.Read - Read activity feed
   - ServiceHealth.Read - Read service health

4. Admin consent is granted for the permissions
5. Generates client secret (30-day expiration)
6. Creates `.env` file with credentials (TENANT_ID, CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET)
   - **Note:** `.env` file is excluded from git - CLIENT_SECRET is never checked into source control

### 3. Configure Assessment Scope

Choose **Option A** or **Option B** to configure which services to assess:

**Option A: Configure in params.py**

Edit `params.py` to specify your tenant and services:

```python
TENANT_ID = "contoso.onmicrosoft.com"  # or Azure AD tenant GUID

# Services to analyze - valid values: "M365", "Entra", "Defender", "Purview", "Power Platform", "Copilot Studio", "A365"
# Empty array = analyze all services
SERVICES = []  # e.g., ["M365", "Entra"], ["Defender", "Purview"], or [] for all
```

Then run:
```powershell
python main.py
```

**Option B: Pass command-line switches**

Override configuration using command-line arguments:

```powershell
# Specific services
python main.py --services M365 Defender Entra

# A365 readiness assessment
python main.py --services A365

# Services with spaces require double quotes
python main.py --services "Power Platform" "Copilot Studio" Purview

# Different tenant with specific services
python main.py --tenant-id "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc" --services Purview

# All services for specific tenant (empty --services flag)
python main.py --tenant-id "contoso.onmicrosoft.com" --services
```

**Note:** Service names with spaces (`"Power Platform"`, `"Copilot Studio"`) must be enclosed in double quotes.

**Configuration Examples:**

- **Full Assessment**: `SERVICES = []` or `--services` (analyzes all available service areas)
- **Targeted Assessment**: `SERVICES = ["M365", "Defender", "Entra"]` or `--services M365 Defender Entra`
- **Security Focus**: `SERVICES = ["Defender", "Entra"]` or `--services Defender Entra`
- **Compliance Focus**: `SERVICES = ["Purview"]` or `--services Purview`
- **Power Platform & Copilot**: `SERVICES = ["Power Platform", "Copilot Studio"]` or `--services "Power Platform" "Copilot Studio"`
- **A365 only**: `SERVICES = ["A365"]` or `--services A365`

**A365 Note:** Selecting `A365` runs delegated data gathering and processing for Agent 365 readiness. The tool performs interactive sign-in, retrieves agent catalog data, fetches available agent details, and writes A365 recommendations to the report.

### 4. Run the Assessment

**Execution Flow:**

1. **Service Principal Authentication**:
   - Tool reads credentials from `.env` file (created in step 2)
   - Authenticates silently using CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET
   - No browser popup - authentication is automatic

2. **Data Collection Progress**:
   - **M365, Entra, Defender**: Silent authentication via service principal
   - **Power Platform & Copilot Studio**: Web popup for user delegated authentication (if assessing these services)
   - **A365**: Interactive Microsoft Graph sign-in (account picker or device code fallback) for Copilot agent catalog access
   - **Purview**: Web popup for Exchange Online PowerShell authentication (if assessing Purview)
   
   See [Data Collection Details](#data-collection-details) for specific APIs and cmdlets used per service.

**Estimated Execution Time:**
- M365 + Entra only: ~10-15 seconds
- All services (without Power Platform/Purview): ~30-45 seconds
- A365 only: ~30-90 seconds (depends on agent catalog size and detail endpoint availability)
- Comprehensive (all services + PowerShell collectors): ~2-3 minutes

## Post-Execution Steps

### 1. Review Assessment Report

Open the generated report from the `Reports/` folder (available in CSV and Excel formats):

```
Reports/m365_recommendations_20260106_143106.csv
Reports/m365_recommendations_20260106_143106.xlsx
```

**Report Structure:**

| Column | Description | Example Values |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Service | Service area assessed | M365, Entra, Defender, Purview, Power Platform, Copilot Studio, A365 |
| Feature | Specific capability or control | Copilot in Apps, Conditional Access, Security Posture |
| Status | Current state | Success, Disabled, Warning, PendingInput |
| Priority | Implementation urgency | High, Medium, Low |
| Observation | What was detected | "247 users with 12,450 files across 15 sites" |
| Recommendation | Actionable next step | "Deploy Copilot training for document-heavy teams" |
| LinkText | Reference title | "Copilot Adoption Framework" |
| LinkUrl | Microsoft Learn link | https://learn.microsoft.com/... |

### 2. Filter and Prioritize Recommendations

**In Excel/CSV viewer:**
1. Sort by **Priority** column (High → Medium → Low)
2. Filter by **Service** to focus on specific areas
3. Group by **Status** to identify gaps (Disabled, Warning)

**Priority Definitions:**
- **High**: Critical for Copilot security/compliance - address before deployment
- **Medium**: Important for optimal experience - implement during deployment
- **Low**: Enhancement opportunities - consider for future optimization

### 3. Implement Recommendations

For each recommendation:

1. **Read the Observation**: Understand current state (e.g., "12 compromised accounts detected")
2. **Review the Recommendation**: Specific action to take (e.g., "Revoke access, enforce MFA")
3. **Follow the LinkUrl**: Microsoft Learn documentation for implementation steps
4. **Track Progress**: Mark as completed in your project management system

**Example Implementation Workflow:**

| Recommendation | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|----------------|-------|----------|--------|
| Address 12 critical Defender recommendations | SecOps Team | Week 1 | In Progress |
| Implement Copilot conditional access policy | Identity Team | Week 2 | Not Started |
| Deploy sensitivity labels to SharePoint | Compliance Team | Week 3 | Not Started |

### 4. Re-run Assessment

After implementing recommendations, re-run the assessment to validate changes:

```powershell
python main.py
```

Compare new report with baseline to measure progress. Timestamped filenames preserve history:
- Baseline: `m365_recommendations_20260106_143106.csv`
- Post-remediation: `m365_recommendations_20260113_091523.csv`

## Special Scenarios

### Defender XDR Activation (First-Time Setup)

If your tenant has Defender licenses but has never accessed the portal:

1. Navigate to [Microsoft Defender Portal](https://security.microsoft.com)
2. Sign in with Security Administrator or Global Administrator account
3. Accept the "Turn on Microsoft Defender XDR" prompt
4. Select data residency region (EU, US, UK, etc.)
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for provisioning
6. Verify activation: Dashboard should display devices, incidents, recommendations
7. Run the assessment tool

**Why manual activation required:**
- Microsoft requires explicit admin consent before enabling tenant-wide monitoring
- Data residency selection cannot be changed after provisioning
- Ensures compliance/governance review before security data collection

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

**Problem:** Authentication prompt or browser popup is hidden behind other windows

**Solution:**
1. Press **Windows + D** to minimize all windows and show desktop
2. Press **Windows key** again to restore windows - the authentication popup should now be highlighted/visible
3. Alternatively, check taskbar for flashing browser icon or new window notification
4. Look for authentication popup minimized or behind VS Code/terminal windows
5. Click the browser icon in taskbar to bring popup to front
6. Complete the authentication in the popup window
7. If timeout occurs, re-run the assessment - popup should appear again

### Defender API Issues

**Problem:** Defender API returns empty data or "403 Forbidden"

**Solution:**
1. Verify Defender XDR is activated via [security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)
2. Confirm user has Security Reader role (or higher) in Defender portal
3. Check licenses: Requires M365 E5, Microsoft 365 E5 Security, or Microsoft Defender P2
4. Wait 10-15 minutes after first Defender XDR activation for APIs to propagate

**Problem:** "DEFENDER_XDR_ACTIVATION" recommendation shows "Warning - Not Activated"

**Solution:** Follow "Defender XDR Activation" steps above (manual portal activation required)

### Purview Issues

**Problem:** Purview collector fails with "Connect-IPPSSession not recognized"

**Solution:**
```powershell
Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement -Force
Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement
```

### General Issues

**Problem:** "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'azure.identity'"

**Solution:**
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Problem:** "429 Too Many Requests" error

**Solution:**
- API throttling triggered - wait 60 seconds and retry
- Reduce scope: Assess fewer services at once
- For large tenants (>10,000 users): Run during off-peak hours

### A365 Issues

**Problem:** A365 flow reports Microsoft.Graph module is missing

**Solution:**
```powershell
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser -Force -AllowClobber
```

**Problem:** A365 sign-in popup is blocked or not visible

**Solution:**
- Complete sign-in in the browser prompt when it appears
- If the popup fails, the tool falls back to device code authentication
- Use https://microsoft.com/devicelogin to complete device code sign-in

**Problem:** A365 returns authorization failures (401/403)

**Solution:**
- Verify you are signing in with an account that has Copilot package catalog read authorization
- Confirm tenant context is correct in `TENANT_ID` or `--tenant-id`
- Retry after re-authenticating to ensure fresh delegated consent

## Next Steps

- **Implement Recommendations**: Prioritize High-priority items before Copilot deployment
- **Establish Baseline**: Save first assessment report as readiness baseline
- **Track Progress**: Re-run monthly to measure improvement
- **Share Results**: Review with stakeholders, security team, compliance officers
- **Plan Deployment**: Use assessment insights to build Copilot rollout plan
